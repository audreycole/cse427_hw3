This homework assignment was lot more challenging for me. I enjoyed working on part 1 where I had to implement the average word count and part 3 where I had to use toolRunner to implement the average word count, but I did not enjoy part 2. I spent a great deal on time trying to get the lab to work, which was super frustrating, which I knew I needed for part 2. Part 2 wasn't as bad as the lab, but because I had to finish the lab before working on it and associated it with bad feelings.
